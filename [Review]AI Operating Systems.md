today I have read this book until the end. <br/>
but, actually after reading this book once, I dont have many things to write about. <br/>
because the reason can be my terrible english skill or that I cant get the knowledge and the purpose I want from this book. <br/><br/>

one thing I have in mind is research. <br/>
by this book, I cant get in-depth knowledge about the AI Operating Systems. <br/>
but, there are a lot of subjects related with topics that I have been interested in. <br/>

I think there is two direction I can take. <br/>
one thing is development and other is research but both of them are valuable. <br/>
but as job seeker for engineer, I think, it will be better to choose the former.
