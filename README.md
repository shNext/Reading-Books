# Operating System

One of my interest is operating system. <br/>
recently I found a book that I want to read a few days ago. <br/>
After reading the book, I'd like to write/share a review. <br/>

Title : AI Operating Systems by H. Peter Alesso. <br/>

a new book has arrived. <br/>
Title : Linux System Internals for Software Engineers by Earl Wright. <br/>

# Compiler

To me, Compiler is a flower. <br/>
Compiler is brige to interface between human and machine. <br/>
although I don't have a experience to develop a compiler from scratch, I think Compiler has everything-core-knowledge to know in computer engineering. <br/>
so, my next topic is a book about the Rust Compiler. <br/>

Title : Mastering the Rust Compiler by Eron Valdric. <br/>

and then <br/>
Title : Essential LLVM Code Architecture by Kepler Publishing , Ethan Kessler.

## Next Topics

Reading these topic in intro/guide level books. <br/>

I wouldn't deep dive into the concept/principle. 

<p>
nano/micro bot -> this topic will be expanded to the its usage with the specific purpose. <br/>
wireless power transfer -> this will be changed to the electromagnetic field and sound. <br/>
